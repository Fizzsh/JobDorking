# JobDorking
JobDorking is a simple Python OSINT script that helps you discover company career pages by generating targeted Google search queries using 'site:' and 'inurl:' operators.

It avoids job board noise, and helps you apply to the job you want and deserve in the quickest way(s) possible- making it ideal for repeatable job reconnaissance across any industry of your choosing!
